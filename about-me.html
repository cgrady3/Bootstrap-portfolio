      <p>I'd be a great asset to your team and here's why! (Hire me).</p>

      <p>I'm currently a student at the University of Central Florida, enrolled in their Computer Science Engineering
        program. I've recently graduated the Trilogy Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.</p>

      <p>All this means I have experience creating web applications, start to finish, and front to back. I have
        experience with C, Java, JavaScript (vanilla and with jquery), HTML, EJS, CSS, Bootstrap. Databases I've used in
        web projects include: Firebase, MySQL, MongoDB, and Heroku. I've utilzed API's and AJAX, having designed my own and
        utilizing the API's of others). Node.js and NPMs, such as Express, Bcrypt, Passport, Handlebars, Axios, and
        Cheerio.</p>

      <p>Me personally? I'm 25 years old, before deciding to get my degree I spent time in the service industry, working
        as a server, bartender, and sales associate. I attended Winter Park HS, was in the IB program, and recieved my
        varsity letters for excellence on the swim and rowing teams. I have a goldren retriever, and a short haired
        white cat. Big on Sci-Fi, card and board games, books, tennis, and sand volleyball.</p>
